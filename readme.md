Welcome to i-surance Developer Test!

This test covers 3 parts: Algorithms, Object Oriented Programming and Testing
You've got 90 minutes to complete it.

It can happen that you don't know how to solve a problem, have never done
a Unit Test or simply run out of time without completing everything. This
test intends to cover several skills we are looking for and you can still
pass it without answering all the questions, so don't give up if you don't
know how to complete SpecialSum!

Please take into account that time is tight so if you struggle at some
point, maybe it's better to skip that part (or write some pseudo-code at least) and give a try to the other questions!

So, read carefully the instructions and good luck!

# General Considerations

We will use PHP as our main backend language. So, PHP should be
used to solve all the problems. But, if you are comfortable with other scripting
languages like Ruby, Python or Java, you can use them in the Algorithms part.

# Algorithms

Try to solve SpecialSum the fastest way possible.
As it is mentioned before, you can solve this with any scripting language.

It should take you about 15-20 minutes to complete this part of the test!

# Object Oriented Programming

This is the longer exercise in the test. The most secure and error-safe your
code, the better! So please, try to take into account any errors that can happen and
use PHP Exceptions to cover them.

It should take you 45-60 minutes to complete this part!

# Testing

We will use PHPUnit to unit and functional test our PHP files so please use this testing
framework to solve this exercise. Usage of proper PHPUnit features (setUp - tearDown
methods, dataProviders, annotations) are taken into account. Also, please try to use
the most accurate assertion in your tests (for instance assertTrue($stuff) is always
better than assertEquals(true, $stuff))

It should take you 10-15 minutes to complete this!


Good luck!
